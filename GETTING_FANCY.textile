h2. Manipulating Terms & Terminologies without Builders



If you want to manipulate Terms and Terminologies directly rather than using the Builder classes, you can consume their APIs at any time.

People don't often do this, but the option is there if you need it.

h3. Create a Terminology and some Terms Without Builders

To achieve this:

<pre>
  builder = OM::XML::Terminology::Builder.new do |t|
    t.root(:xmlns=>"http://yourmediashelf.com/schemas/hydra-dataset/v0")
    t.grant {
      t.organization {
        t.name
      }
      t.number
    }
  end
  another_terminology = builder.build
</pre>

You could also do this:

<pre>
include OM::XML
handcrafted_terminology = Terminology.new

# Create term1 (the root), set its xmlns and set it as the root term
term1 = Term.new(:xmlns=>"http://yourmediashelf.com/schemas/hydra-dataset/v0")
term1.is_root_term = true

# Create term2 (grant) and its subterms
term2 = Term.new(:name=>"grant", :path=>"grant")
subterm1 = Term.new(:name=>"organization", :path=>"organization")
subterm2 = Term.new(:name=>"number", :path=>"number")
subsubterm = Term.new(:name=>"name_", :path=>"name")

# Assemble the tree of terms by adding child terms to their parents, then add those to the Terminology.
subterm1.add_child(subsubterm)
term2.add_child(subterm1)
term2.add_child(subterm2)
handcrafted_terminology.add_term(term1)
handcrafted_terminology.add_term(term2)
</pre>

Test it out:

<pre>
  handcrafted_terminology.retrieve_term(:organization, :name)
  handcrafted_terminology.xpath_for(:organization, :name)
  handcrafted_terminology.root_terms
</pre>
