# What is om?

A library to help you tame sprawling XML schemas like MODS.

OM allows you to define a "terminology" to ease translation between XML and ruby objects â€“ you can query the xml for Nodes or node values without ever writing a line of XPath.

OM "terms" are ruby symbols you define (in the terminology) that map specific XML content into ruby object attributes.
